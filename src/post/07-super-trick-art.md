Super Trick Art is yet another of those 3D art places that you pose in front of. The lighting is a bit dark in places and it has also hard to use bounce flash because the ceiling is high and painted black. So we ended up taking most of the photos using just natural light but unfortunately many of the pictures look a bit dark. Still, we had fun and some of the artwork were a bit weirder than usual.

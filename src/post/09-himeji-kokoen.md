Koko-en (好古園) is a Japanese garden located next to Himeji Castle.

This strolling-landscape-type Japanese garden was built to commemorate Himeji City’s 100th anniversary. It features ponds and springs against the backdrop of Himeji Castle. Actually, the garden consists of 9 separate Japanese traditional gardens. The area used to be the former site of a Himeji Lord’s Residence and his men’s samurai houses. The garden covers an area of 3.5 hectares.

The 9 gardens featured in Koko-en are:

- **The garden of the Lord’s residence**, the biggest garden, including a pond with carp, a roofed corridor, and the Cho-on-sai guest house
- **garden of seedlings**, containing plants grown during the Edo era
- **tea ceremony garden** with Soujo-an tea house
- **flatly landscaped garden**, a country style garden
- **garden of summer trees**, with a view of Himeji Castle
- **the garden of pine trees**
- **garden of flowers**, with flowers popular during the Edo period
- **the garden with a hill and pond**, with a tortoise shaped rock in the pond and a Japanese crane shaped stone slab
- **garden of bamboo**.

The garden’s passage-ways are traditional mud walls, called “Tsuiji-bei.” The walls have roof-tiles. Flowing streams, waterfalls and ponds join up and connect the distinct gardens.

In addition, there are also beautiful wooden gates like:

- “Yashiki-mon” (gate to “The Lord’s Residence”)
- “Nagaya-mon”, a traditional style gate with two guard-rooms.

The [official website](http://www.himeji-machishin.jp/ryokka/kokoen/en/index.php) has an English section.

We really enjoyed visiting the garden. I didn’t realise at the time the garden is relatively young. We thought the garden must be centuries old. The garden has been used as a location for a number of Japanese films.

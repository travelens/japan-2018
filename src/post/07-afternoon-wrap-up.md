After having tendon for lunch again (we are creatures of habit, and it seems the easiest meal to digest after a heavy breakfast), we wandered around the park to catch any final sights or attractions that we missed on the first day. The Patlabor displays were interesting (giant robots plus an exhibit area outside the Robot Palace). One of the weirdest things we saw was a theatre screening of &#8230; anime boy bands. I must admit, I like anime, I can even be persuaded to like some boy bands, but for the life of me I am not sure what to make of watching an anime of boy bands singing. Clearly aimed at a teenage girl audience, nevertheless I saw an old man in the cinema &#8211; not sure what he thought of the whole thing.

We finished off by returning back to the hotel of a brief rest before visiting the park again for the evening parade.

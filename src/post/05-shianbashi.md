For dinner we took the streetcar to Nagasaki station to the nearby Amu Plaza. I had a simple dish of seafood broth. After that we explored Tokyo Hands and headed back and had a quick stroll around the Shianbashi area before returning to the hotel to pack as we are checking out the following morning.

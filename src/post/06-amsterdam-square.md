This evokes the famous Dam Square with a building in the centre that is vaguely reminiscent of the Royal Palace / former Town Hall but is actually the Stut House. In front is a flower clock and on the rear are some tulip beds. Nearby is a shopping centre called The Passage and there is a secondary area with a carrousel, a European village (mainly selling beer) and giant clogs which make good photo opportunities.

We also saw people cycling around and took a photo with a giant Miffy.

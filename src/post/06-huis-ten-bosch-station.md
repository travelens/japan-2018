Once we arrived at the tiny but very, very cute JR Huis Ten Bosch station, we walked across a bridge over the Haiki Seto Strait to the Huis Ten Bosch theme park. A very large hotel with a very impressive European style architecture (Hotel Okura JR) dominates the landscape.

Huis Ten Bosch is a fairly unique theme park in that it is modelled after a stylised version of Holland, including windmills, tulips, famous buildings, streets, restaurants etc. so someone living in Japan could imagine they are visiting the Netherlands without the bother of passports, travelling, or having to learn a foreign language. Of course, all the &#8220;buildings&#8221; are fake and house either attractions, galleries, souvenir shops or food outlets. It&#8217;s a concept that I cannot imagine working anywhere else in the world except Japan, hence it was a very unique experience for us.

We left our luggage at Hotel Nikko Huis Ten Bosch and entered the park. There are a few photo opportunities just after the entrance.

We woke up and had the buffet breakfast at the hotel. Not only was it super crowded and we had to queue to get in, but the food wasn&#8217;t very delicious &#8211; definitely the low point in our trip as far as breakfasts are concerned. We headed back to the entrance, converted our vouchers into day passes, took a few photos and headed to the Flower Road. It was still early so not too many people around. We checked out the Cheese Waag &#8211; it was super expensive.

After that we slowly made our way past Amsterdam Square back to the Domtoren and headed out towards Harbour Town.

We saw some people on Segways touring around the park. The women told me she was a bit scared so I shouted out &#8220;気を付けてね&#8221; (Please take care of yourself!)

We also visited the atomic bomb hypocentre, which had concentric circles marked around it like a bullseye target, and the nearby remains of the Urakami church which was destroyed by the blast.Â On the 9th of August 1945, at 11:02 A.M., a B29 airplane dropped the nuclear bomb. It exploded 500m above the hypocentre. Looking at it now, it is hard to imagine the destruction that must have happened on that day.

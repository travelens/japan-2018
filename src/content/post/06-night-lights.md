We headed back to the theme park at dusk at ate saraudon for dinner at a Chinese restaurant at the Domtoren. After that we watched the evening parade and wandered around the park. It&#8217;s a bit like Vivid in Sydney &#8211; a lot of the buildings are lit up and there&#8217;s a spectacular lightshow of a fountain that seem to flow down from the Domtoren onto the Art Garden. We also had fun taking photos around the fountain in Thriller City and along the Flower Road where the windmills are lit up.

Our next stop is Canaltown where we boarded a cruiser that takes us on a journey along the artificial canal built around the theme park all the way to Tower City where a replica of the Domtoren is. The cruise passes through some interesting residential areas (all built to resemble European houses) that are actually not part of the theme park itself.

On our return back to the station, we couldn’t resist stopping by at a Hello Kitty themed cafe called Cafe de Miki. This is located in the covered shopping street (Miyuki Street).

Just in case you didn’t get that the cafe is Hello Kitty themed, the full name of the cafe is “Cafe de Miki with Hello Kitty”. Satisfied now?

In addition to buying food, the cafe also sells Hello Kitty items such as cups and plush toys. The food is of course quite sweet, consisting of waffles, scones and pancakes.

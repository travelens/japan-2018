On our last night at Huis Ten Bosch we went back to the Domtoren to try out a ramen place called Meifan. After that we stayed back to watch the night parade and soak up the atmosphere as we are leaving the next day back to Osaka. It&#8217;s been an interesting trip and we are glad to have visited this rather unique theme park. The Dutch setting coupled with the high tech attractions focusing on robots and VR certainly makes an interesting combination!

We ended up taking some photos at the courtyard garden of the hotel.

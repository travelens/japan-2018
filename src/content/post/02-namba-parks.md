We then visited Namba City, the shopping mall attached to Namba Station. There is a large Uniqlo and a large bookshop here. We then walked to Namba Park, another huge (and rather posh) shopping centre with an interesting architecture &#8211; there&#8217;s a terraced rooftop garden and you can literally walk down one side of the mall. The centre of the mall is a large artificial canyon. We had an early dinner upstairs at a restaurant specialising in fried rice called Canton Fried rice restaurant or 広東茶華店. We ordered two fried rice, which is basically their two most popular dishes &#8211; a bacon and cheese fried rice, a prawn and vegetables fried rice in some sort of gravy (very similar to Hokkien fried rice) and a Ma Po tofu mini pot. The meal was quite filling.

After dinner, we wanted down the floors of Namba Park. There is a good stationery shop here. We then walked back to the hotel but stopped to take a few pictures at Dotonbori bridge along the way.

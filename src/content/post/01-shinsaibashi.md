We arrived the previous day having from on Qantas business class (yes, we splurged out) from Sydney to Kansai International Airport. The plane departed late because of a sick passenger. When we arrived, the immigration hall was full of people and there was a large queue. The immigration officer was impressed when I said in my best Japanese &#8220;宜しくお願いいたします&#8221; I did notice a body temperature scanner so I was quite relieved when I got through as I didn&#8217;t feel too well (but I probably didn&#8217;t have a fever).

Once we exited baggage and customs, we were greeted by a representative from InsideJapan tours. She guided us to the train station where she purchased tickets on the Nankai Airport Line. She said it was too late for the Rapi:t Express so we just went on the normal Airport Express train which stops at 12 stations. The journey did not take too long, but the train was quite crowded and I had to stand most of the way.

Once we reached Namba (難波) Station, we walked along the Midosuji (御堂筋), Osaka&#8217;s famous boulevard that connects all the major central shopping districts. It was freezing cold and we were shivering but fortunately The Cross Hotel wasn&#8217;t too far and was on our right pretty soon after crossing Dotonbori (道頓堀) Bridge which crosses the famous canal. The hotel is fairly modern and the rooms are quite pleasant.

Woke up 6:30am really hungry. The breakfast at the Cross Hotel was really impressive, with a good selection of Japanese vegetable dishes. I particularly liked the octopus linguine and sausage.

We then headed out along Midosuji towards Amerikamura (literally, &#8220;American village&#8221;). According to the itinerary, we are actually supposed to be visiting the Tezuka Osamu Manga Museum, but I wasn&#8217;t feeling so well, so we decided just to walk around the neighbourhood.

We visited the Apple Store, then walked to Triangle Park. A lot of the stores were still closed as it was too early. We then headed to the underground mall connecting the Shinsaibashi and Nagahoribashi stations (called Crysta Nagahori).&nbsp;Discovered a good 100 yen shop called Seria, also visited 3coins+ &#8211; a 300 yen shop. Bought some stockings and underwear from a lingerie shop.

We had lunch at Tenya Akasuka Tendon &#8211; a chain of restaurants serving delicious but cheap tempura with rice or udon. We have eaten at the original store in Asakusa, Tokyo, in our Japan 2017 trip so I knew the food was good. I had the All Star which consists of fish, prawn, green bean, mushroom, scallop together with rice and miso soup.

After Crysta Nagahori, we walked down Sakaisuji Avenue, bought some water from Family Mart convenience store. I always love visiting Family Mart because it was featured in Whisper of the Heart, a Studio Ghibli anime film.

We then walked along Suomachi-dori (Europe-dori) but it was quite boring most of the shops were closed. Discovered a cat cafe and astrological themed manholes here. Of course I had to take a photo of the Leo manhole.

We then walked along Shinsaibashisuji shopping street. This is basically a covered lane way with shops on both sides. There is a Sanrio Gallery here as well as Uniqlo. I also discovered a pachinko parlour called surprisingly Atariya.

We then walked all the way to Semba Centre which is a mall under the Chuo-odori elevated freeway and returned back to Shinsaibashisuji and stepped into the Daimaru department store (see next post).

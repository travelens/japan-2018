On our last day in Osaka, we wandered around the block from the hotel and ended up in Osaka Station City, a large shopping mall attached to JR Osaka station.

This is a large mall with a top level full of restaurants, a Daimaru department store, and an under roof open space. We enjoyed browsing through the mall. After that, we reluctantly headed back to the hotel to pack, before heading to Kansai International Airport via a shuttle bus. We are so sad to leave Japan once again and hope to return in the future.

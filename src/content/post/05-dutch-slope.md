After Glover Garden, we visited the Dutch slope. This strangely named &#8220;tourist attraction&#8221; really is what it seems &#8211; it&#8217;s just a sloping road leading up to a hill where there are many historical Western style houses belonging to foreign traders.

The area is actually called Higashi-Yamate Machi and contains the Kwassui Gakuin School and Kaisei Gakuen School.

One of the buildings that was open to the public is the former Latin Divinity School.Â A Japanese man spent a long time explaining the history of the building to us in Japanese which I only understood partly.

Today we woke up, had breakfast at the hotel again (it hasn&#8217;t really improved, but today we managed to get in before the crowds came in so it was easier getting the food). We checked out of the hotel and made our way back to the Huis Ten Bosch station, before bidding it farewell to board a Seaside Express back to Nagasaki, and then retracing our steps back to Hakata on the Limited Express and then Shinkansen all the way to Shin Osaka. From here we caught a JR train to Osaka then headed to the Ritz Carlton Hotel where we stayed last year (we liked the hotel so much we decided to return).

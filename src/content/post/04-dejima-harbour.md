We walked through the [Nagasaki Seaside Park][1]. This offers views of Dejima Harbour and incoming boats, plus open space for walking, jogging and picnics. The Japanese name for this park is a mouthful: mizubenomorikouen (長崎水辺の森公園). The [Nagasaki Prefectural Art Museum][2] is also nearby.

We finally ended up in [Nagasaki Dejima Wharf][3], which has a number of restaurants. We had champon for lunch at [Ringer Hut][4], a chain of restaurants originated from Nagasaki and specialising in two Nagasaki dishes: champon (Chinese soupy noodles) and saraudon (Chinese style fried noodles). The name Ringer Hut supposedly is an amalgamation of Ringer House (now part of Glover Garden &#8211; a popular tourist attraction) and Pizza Hut. Ringer House was the residence of Frederick Ringer, a British merchant and founder of the Nagasaki Press. The lunch was absolutely delicious and filling.

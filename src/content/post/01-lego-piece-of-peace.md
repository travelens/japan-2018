Whilst we were at the Daimaru department store at Shinsaibashi, we noticed it was hosting an exhibition called LEGO Piece of Peace World Heritage Exhibition, so we decided to visit it. It&#8217;s basically a collection of LEGO models of World Heritage sites and buildings, including the Sydney Opera House but also featuring many models from neighbouring Asian countries including the Great Wall of China and the Taj Mahal but also the bandstand from Singapore Botanic Gardens. I had a chat with one of the exhibition attendees and told her I would love to visit all the sites in real life (in my best Japanese).

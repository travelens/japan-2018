“Harbor Town” is an unticketed area of Huis Ten Bosch, so we have to exit via turnstiles and need to show our ticket to get back in, but it contains some theme park attractions, such as the Game Museum and the Porcelain Museum. However, the shops here are open to the public, and there is a marina that also contains the Huis Ten Bosch Floating Hotel. There is a replica of a Dutch ship that sailed into Japan in the 17th century called De Liefde. The Watermark Hotel is also here as well as a replica of the Huis Ten Bosch itself (which we didn’t go in as there was a separate admission fee to see the museum).

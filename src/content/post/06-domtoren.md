After the canal cruise, we docked at the base of the replica of Domtoren &#8211; the famous church tower in Utrecht. There is a &#8220;cheap&#8221; food court (by theme park standards) and we had a nice tempura lunch here &#8211; it was just enough after our heavy breakfast.

We then headed up to the Domtoren observation deck. From here we can see a bird&#8217;s eye view of the entire theme park and it&#8217;s quite amazing how extensive it is and how &#8220;European&#8221; it looks compared to the rest of Japan.
